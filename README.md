# Bone Fracture Detection

Bone Fracture Detection is a web-based application that uses machine learning to identify fractures in X-ray images. The app is designed to help healthcare professionals analyze X-ray scans and identify potential bone fractures quickly and accurately. The frontend is built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive UI, and the backend uses **Flask** for handling the machine learning model and image processing.

## Features

- **Fracture Detection**: Uses a machine learning model to detect fractures in uploaded X-ray images.
- **User Interface**: A clean, modern interface built using **Tailwind CSS** for responsiveness and ease of use.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload X-ray images for analysis.
- **Real-time Results**: Provides immediate feedback on whether the X-ray shows a fracture or not.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The backend integrates a pre-trained model for image analysis, capable of identifying fractures in bone X-rays.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Pre-trained deep learning models (TensorFlow, Keras)
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV or similar libraries for image analysis

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Flask for creating the backend
- Required Python libraries for machine learning (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS for the frontend
